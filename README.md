# Rainfall-Prediction
**🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Linear Regression**

A machine learning project that predicts rainfall based on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, etc. The model is built using Linear Regression and implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**📌 Project Overview**

Predicting rainfall is an important application in meteorology and agriculture.
In this project, we build a simple Linear Regression model to predict the amount of rainfall using historical weather data.


**📂 Dataset**

The dataset contains weather-related features such as:

🌡️ Temperature

💧 Humidity

🌬️ Wind Speed

☁️ Cloud Cover

🌦️ Rainfall (Target Variable)

**📌 Dataset Source**
Dataset downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subho117/rainfall-prediction-using-machine-learning Dataset belongs to the original author as per Kaggle licensing. Used here for educational and research purposes only.

The model learns the relationship between weather features and rainfall amounts.


**🔧 Technologies & Libraries**

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

**🚀 How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rainfall-prediction.git

2. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook Rainfall_prediction.ipynb

Or open directly in Google Colab.

**📊 Workflow
**
1. Importing libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data cleaning and preprocessing
5. Feature selection
6. Splitting data into train/test
7. Training the Linear Regression model
8. Evaluating performance (MAE, MSE, R² Score)
9. Predicting rainfall on new data
